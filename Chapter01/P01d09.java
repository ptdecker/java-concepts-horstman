/**
 * Programming Exercise P1.9
 * Java Concepts, 6th Edition, by Cay Horstmann
 *
 * NOTE: This exercise introduces a Java GUI framework called 'Swing'. There
 *       is much to it and Chapter 1 doesn't touch on any of it. But, the book
 *       is just trying to give you a taste of what is possible with Java.

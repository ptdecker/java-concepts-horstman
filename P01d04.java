/**
 * Programming Exercise P1.4
 * Java Concepts, 6th Edition, by Cay Horstmann
 *
 * NOTE: The key to getting this to work is to remember that certain characters
 *       in Java strings are special characters and must be 'escaped'. The Horstmann
 *       text does not cover this in detail in Chapter 1 as best I can tell. 
 *       See http://www.c-point.com/javascript_tutorial/special_characters.htm
 *       The backslash character starts and escape sequence. So, if you want Java
 *       to print a backslash as opposed to starting an escape sequence, you have to 
 *       use two backslash characters, i.e. "\\"
